  content: Through the progression of each technical aspect, our final designed BWB
    concept was able to hold 562 passengers in a 2-class configuration; up to 31.8%
    higher volume of cargo compared to B747-8F when operate as a freighter. At full
    passenger load, the BWB achieved up to 12.5% Direct Operating Cost (DOC) reduction
    per nm-pax and 18% less CO2 emission compared to the Airbus A380.
