  content: "We are a multi-disciplinary team of 6 Mechanical Engineers studying towards
    MEng degree at the University of Strathclyde. \n\nWe are working together as part
    of the 5th year group project, aiming to present a design and investigate the
    feasibility of the Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft for use as a commercial passenger
    and cargo transport aircraft, through the utilisation of Soft Systems Methodology."

  title: We believe in the future of aviation.
  content: "The aviation industry accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, alongside
    with non-CO2 pollutants exhausted from jet fuel consumptions, its climate impact
    on the global warming becomes alarming. \n\nAs the 2050 carbon net-zero goal setting
    in place, more efficient technology is in urgent need to be developed for the
    future growth of the aviation industry. While conventional tube-and-wing aircraft
    are reaching the capping limit of aerodynamic efficiency, various innovative aircraft
    concepts for being developed.\n\nBlended Wing Body aircraft configuration is notably
    one of them. We, as a team of graduate-level engineers, are exploring this possible
    alternative and determining the feasibility of such concept for long haul flights
    from both technical and commercial perspectives."
