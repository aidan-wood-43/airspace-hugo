  content: "We are a multi-disciplinary team of 6 Mechanical Engineers studying towards
    MEng degree at the University of Strathclyde. \n\nWe are working together as part
    of the 5th year group project, aiming to present a design and investigate the
    feasibility of the Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft for use as a commercial passenger
    and cargo transport aircraft, through the utilisation of Soft Systems Methodology."

  title: We believe in the future of aviation.
  content: "The aviation industry accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, alongside
    with non-CO2 pollutants exhausted from jet fuel consumptions, its climate impact
    on the global warming becomes alarming. \n\nAs the 2050 carbon net-zero goal setting
    in place, more efficient technology is in urgent need to be developed for the
    future growth of the aviation industry. While conventional tube-and-wing aircraft
    are reaching the capping limit of aerodynamic efficiency, various innovative aircraft
    concepts for being developed.\n\nBlended Wing Body aircraft configuration is notably
    one of them. We, as a team of graduate-level engineers, are exploring this possible
    alternative and determining the feasibility of such concept for long haul flights
    from both technical and commercial perspectives."

      I’m in my final year studying MEng Aero-Mechanical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde. My previous research projects include CFD simulations on micro wind turbines and bicycle wheels.

      I enjoy painting, origami and photography, sometimes baking soggy cakes. I spent my Christmas learning crocheting instead of Python.

      I love planes.

      I'm a fifth year MEng Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Strathclyde. My interests lie in automation, optimisation, and satellite imagery.

      When I get away from my desk I enjoy being outside, running, and riding my bike.
