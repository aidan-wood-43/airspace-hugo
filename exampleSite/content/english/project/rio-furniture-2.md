## **Breaking the Limitation of Conventional Aerodynamic Properties**

Through CFD analysis using STAR CCM+, the lift and drag properties of the BWB aircraft were investigated.

While the wing area is reduced as a result of the substantially wider fuselage for a BWB aircraft, the ability to employ the fuselage as a lifting surface also mean that an L/D value similar to that of a modern airliner such as an A380. The implementation of traditional wing optimisation techniques such as washout and wing tapering were effective in both the increase in lift in reduction in drag that saw the requirements met for the aerodynamic characteristics of the airframe. The L/D ratio at common cruising speed is shown in the table below.
