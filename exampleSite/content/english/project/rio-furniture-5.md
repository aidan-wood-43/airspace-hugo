## Bringing Together Subsystems, Solving for a Global Design Challenge

The 4 Activities model is the current favoured expression of Soft Systems Methdology, which has been in continous development by Peter Checkland for the past 40 years. Originally expressed in the form of The 7 Steps model, application of the methodology through diverse industry applications lead to the evolution to a more flexible model: The 4 Actvities model. This model essentially encapsulates all seven steps previously described in a broader and more relaxed format, which better facilitates the ever-changing nature of the problems being tackled.

Soft Systems Methdology (SSM) allowed for a fluid and adaptable process, promoting consideration of human nature and the transience of perceived optimal solutions. Therefore, it was an apt fit for the projects multidisciplinary nature and the multitude of competing design elements of a commercial aircraft. SSM provided an excellent framework to assess the various design activities required and their inter-dependencies, in a manner in which it would have been easy to adjust should a certain aspect for optimisation been chosen. As SSM is primarily focused on developing the learning process regarding the situation of the problem and how such complex problems should be overcome, it was optimum for the project aim and allowed deeper, more rounded engineering knowledge and experience to be gained by the team.

Detailed information regarding the Systems thinking and the SSM models can be found in our blog posts, as well as further information and their application in our report.
