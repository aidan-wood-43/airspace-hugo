## Bringing Together Subsystems, Solving for a Global Design Challenge

Soft Systems Methdology (SSM) allowed for a fluid and adaptable process, promoting consideration of human nature and the transience of perceived optimal solutions. Therefore, it was an apt fit for the projects multidisciplinary nature and the multitude of competing design elements of a commercial aircraft. SSM provided an excellent framework to assess the various design activities required and their inter-dependencies, in a manner in which it would have been easy to adjust should a certain aspect for optimisation been chosen. As SSM is primarily focused on developing the learning process regarding the situation of the problem and how such complex problems should be overcome, it was optimum for the project aim and allowed deeper, more rounded engineering knowledge and experience to be gained by the team.
