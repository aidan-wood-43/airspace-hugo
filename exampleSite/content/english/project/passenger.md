## **Reimaging the Cabin Capacity of Future Aviation**

### **2-Class**

With 479.6 square meter cabin floor area, the single-deck BWB is capable of carrying comparable number of passengers with the current largest passenger aircraft A380.

The wide space available also allows creative customisation for additional catering facilities.

### **1-Class**

With the un-optimised single class configuration, BWB holds 604 passengers with widened seats compared to the A380. The capacity may further increased by allowing a double-deck structure.
