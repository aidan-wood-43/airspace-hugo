## High Strength, Low Cost

Materials selection for key structural components confirm that it is feasible to implement the proposed design using currently employed advanced aluminium alloys; in particular, 2024 T6 and 7075 T6 alloys which are currently employed on Airbus and Boeing aircraft. Ensuring the feasibility of the design with contemporary materials is vitally important within the aerospace industry, which is slow to adopt new material types. Aluminium alloys are easy to manufacture, relatively cheap, and can be recycled easily at the end of life. While CFRP materials are omitted for primary structural components in this feasibility study, it is accepted that as the cost of manufacture continues to fall, these components will constitute a greater percentage of the complete aircraft material makeup, following current trends in the aviation industry.
