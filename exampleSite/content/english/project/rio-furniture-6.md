## High Strength, Low Cost

In aerospace design, minimising mass and maximising strength or stiffness are common objectives. Materials selection can be broken down into two main steps:

1. Identification of the desired material attribute profile.
2. Comparison with real materials to find the optimum selection.

Ashby's method provides the perfect framework for material selection:

By implementing this frame work for key structural components of the BWB aircraft, the materials selected were confirmed to be advanced aluminium alloys; in particular, 2024 T6 and 7075 T6 alloys which are currently employed on Airbus and Boeing aircraft. 

Ensuring the feasibility of the design with contemporary materials is vitally important within the aerospace industry, which is slow to adopt new material types. Aluminium alloys are easy to manufacture, relatively cheap, and can be recycled easily at the end of life. While CFRP materials are omitted for primary structural components in this feasibility study, it is accepted that as the cost of manufacture continues to fall, these components will constitute a greater percentage of the complete aircraft material makeup, following current trends in the aviation industry.
