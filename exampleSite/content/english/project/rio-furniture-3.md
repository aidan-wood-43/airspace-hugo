- label: Overview
  info: Propulsion requirements were outlined through comparison to A380 performance
    and through an iterative cycle based on basic thrust equations. A weight estimation
    method was also constructed in order to provide a more accurate estimate to be
    used in design calculations. Subsequently, engine selection for the required calculated
    parameters was undertaken and the benefits of various engines placements were
    explored.

## Exploring High Efficiency Engine Choices and Fuel Resources

The BWB allows for different, less traditional methods of propulsion to be proposed for the design of an efficient propulsion system. In literature, aft-mounted engine placement was found to have a greater than 10% average and maximum L/D in comparison with the under-wing mounted design. This is due to the aft-mounted engines decreasing the frontal area of the overall geometry rather significantly and hence decreasing the overall aerodynamic drag of the design and positively impacting the lift distribution of the design.

Given the thrust requirement for the BWB, the GE-90 engine was chosen for its high Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) and its wide utilisation in the industry. This would mean the BWB could again, integrate into the real world with more practicality and ease, as opposed to designing a whole new engine at significant time and expense.
