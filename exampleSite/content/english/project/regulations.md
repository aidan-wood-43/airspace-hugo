info = "Given the current location of the team in Scotland, the governing body for aircraft worthiness and regulation is the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and therefore the regulations from such body were adhered to.  EASA provide documents and regulations for a wide variety of air transport and their surrounding factors. Given the size and purpose of our BWB aircraft, the appropriate legislation to follow was the Certification Specifications for Large Aeroplanes (CS-25). Besides dictating various structural aspects of the design, strict aherence was applied when considering practical factors such as in an emergency evacuation, interior layout and cargo configuration. Additional EASA documentation, (Transport of Cargo in Passenger Compartment - Exemptions Under Article 71(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139), was consulted when considering the cargo-passenger configuration which many aircraft have utilised during the current pandemic.

## **Abiding by EASA CS-25, Ensuring the Industry Standards are Met**

### **Emergency Evacuation**

#### A380

An initial validation study was performed considering a single class A380 configuration (868 seats), with an expected egress period of roughly 80 seconds when using exits on only one side of the aircraft. When all exits were available, evacuation was performed on average in 44 seconds. The A380 evacuation simulation is shown in the gif:

### BWB

Applying the simulation to the proposed single-class BWB configuration (604 seats), complete egress is observed to be achieved on average in 55 seconds. This is significantly below the requirements of CS-25, but is longer than the egress period for the larger 868 seat A380. The BWB evacuation simulation is shown in the gif:
