## Abiding by EASA CS-25, Ensuring the Industry Standards are Met

An initial validation study was performed considering a single class A380 configuration (868 seats), with an expected egress period of roughly 80 seconds when using exits on only one side of the aircraft. When all exits were available, evacuation was performed on average in 44 seconds. The A380 evacuation simulation is shown in the gif:

Applying the simulation to the proposed single-class BWB configuration (604 seats), complete egress is observed to be achieved on average in 55 seconds. This is significantly below the requirements of CS-25, but is longer than the egress period for the larger 868 seat A380. The BWB evacuation simulation is shown in the gif:
