## **Optimising Cargo Capacity, Superseding the Current Industry Frontier**

### **Cargo**

The BWB was found to hold up to 31.8% higher capacity compared to B747-8F. 13.6% higher if only standard containers were used. The BWB freighter holds up to 972.8 cubic meter of cargo, with capacity of holding standard containers on the main deck listed in the table below:

### Passenger-Cargo

Due to the volatility of the aviation industry, the passenger carrying market may subject to stall in events such as a pandemic. For this reason, passenger aircraft may be necessary to quickly adapt to market change; hence the passenger-cargo ability was also explored based on EASA regulation. Total loading volume of the BWB is 208.2 cubic meters with seats in place.
