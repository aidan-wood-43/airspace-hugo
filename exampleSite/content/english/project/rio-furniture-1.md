information:
- label: Overview
  info: Based on the aircraft characteristics of each design iteration, the development
    cost and minimum number of sold aircraft units for break-even were determined
    using the Eastlake 17model, the DOC per nautical mile per passenger for both long
    and short haul flights at low, normal, and high fuel prices was investigated using
    the AEA model. Both the development cost and DOC results were compared to the
    counterpart aircraft A380 in order to determine the economic viability of the
    final BWB design.

## **Maximising the Profitability of Airlines**

For ensuring the new BWB concept is profitable from both an aircraft manufacturer's and airline's perspective, 2 cost parameters are being considered using their suitable evaluation models through each design iterations:

1. Development and manufacturing costs
   * The Eastlake model
2. The Direct Operating Cost (DOC)
   * The AEA (Association of European Airlines) model

***

### **1 / Development and manufacturing costs**

Due to the significant weight and thrust savings, overall production costs are reduced, further driving down the required acquisition cost for airlines.

### **2 / Direct Operating Cost (DOC)**

A large percentage of the DOC for airlines is fuel costs. With high lift-to-drag ratio, the BWB encapsulates high fuel efficiency characteristics.
