## **Maximising the Profitability of Airlines**

For ensuring the new BWB concept is profitable from both an aircraft manufacturer's and airline's perspective, 2 cost parameters are being considered using their suitable evaluation models through each design iterations:

1. Development and manufacturing costs
   * The Eastlake model
2. The Direct Operating Cost (DOC)
   * The AEA (Association of European Airlines) model

***

### **1 / Development and manufacturing costs**

Due to the significant weight and thrust savings, overall production costs are reduced, further driving down the required acquisition cost for airlines.

### **2 / Direct Operating Cost (DOC)**

A large percentage of the DOC for airlines is fuel costs. With high lift-to-drag ratio, the BWB encapsulates high fuel efficiency characteristics.
