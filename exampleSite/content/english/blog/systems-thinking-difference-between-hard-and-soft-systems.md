Soft Systems Methodology? You are probably wondering what that is, I certainly was when we began this project. I hadn’t encountered systems thinking in my academic career before, and I certainly didn’t know what classed it as soft. So before understanding of Soft Systems Methodology can be gained, it is necessary to have a general idea of systems thinking and what constitutes a hard or soft system.

Systems thinking was first introduced in the 1950s with the intention of providing a universal language and framework which would be able to express and solve any problems encountered in a diverse range of disciplines, encouraging the unity of science \[1\]. Generally, a system can be regarded as the situation in which there is a problem, and it is believed that this system can be expressed as a collection of interacting sub-systems which act independently. It promotes a holistic approach to the understanding of the system through the exploration of the inter-dependencies, perspectives, and boundaries of the sub-systems. Systems thinking methodologies provide a logical thought process to arrive at a solution while appreciating all the contributing factors and possibilities.

Problems encountered can generally be regarded as either a hard system or a soft system, where appropriate hard or soft approaches would be required to tackle them. At its essence, in hard systems engineering the problem world is systemic, whereas in soft systems engineering the process of enquiry is systemic. The 4 predominant areas of contrasting perception are as follows:

**Problem Definition**

Primarily, a problem can be defined as a hard or soft system from the problem definition. A hard system has a straight-forward singular problem, focusing on the production of a solution to meet a need. Alternatively, a soft system has a multi-faceted problem which is itself problematic due to the assumption of transience regarding perceptions and preferred outcomes surrounding the problem, therefore focusing on constructing a process which can account for these inevitable shifts \[2\].

**Nature of Organisation**

Secondary to this is the view of the nature of organisations. For any organisation involved, the hard approach regards these as constants, almost robotic, in that no deviations to the objective will occur. The soft approach recognises the organisation is composed of humans who may behave unpredictably or politically, accounting for any unforeseen circumstances which may occur due to human nature.

**Models**

Thirdly, there is a contrasting view of the purpose of the models. Following a hard approach, a model will be realised as an accurate representation of the real world where technicalities are vital, and it must be validated against its inspiration. In direct opposition to the strict formation of the hard approach, the model of the soft approach is allowed to develop as all factors are considered and integrated – allowing a cycle of progression of both the model and a solution.

**Outcome**

Finally, the last difference is the form of the outcome. As previously mentioned, a hard system problem aims towards the development of a sound solution, whether that be a product, adjustment or recommendation. However, a soft approach aims for the development of learning and understanding which may or may not culminate in a tangible solution \[2\]. It is, rather, a way of becoming adept at navigating dynamic situations and maintaining a comprehensive view of necessary considerations.

In conclusion, a hard approach is a regimented and detail-oriented process whereby a solution to an easily defined problem is achieved, where a soft approach is a fluid and adaptable process promoting consideration of human nature and the transience of perceived optimal solutions. The key differences are summarised in the table below.
