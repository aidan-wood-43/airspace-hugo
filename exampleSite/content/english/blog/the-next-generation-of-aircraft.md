We all know what an aircraft looks like. There might be many different variations, but most planes we have travelled on all share the common tube-and-wing structure.

As the name of the structure implies, the conventional aircraft has a tubular body for payloads, and apparent wing and tailplane structures for lift generation and stability. This configuration has been around for more than 80 years, since the development of Heinkel He 178, the first aircraft to fly with turbojet power.

The long history of the tube-and-wing structure made the technology for manufacturing gradually matured, the tube shape can be easily manufactured in sections, as well as extended and shortened to suit different needs for different aircraft models.

Airbus Global Market Forecast predicted annual air traffic growth rate of 4.3%, and fleet to be doubled over the next 20 years. These surely proves the huge success in the commercialisation of the conventional aircraft design.

But it does have its downfalls, the most significant being its low efficiency in carrying payloads, as the body makes close to zero contribution to sustaining the flight in mid-air. All the lift forces that are equivalent to the weight of the aircraft are acting solely on the wings, the high stress concentration at the fuselage and wing junction makes it necessary to locally reenforced the structure, which means an increase in structural mass.

Engineers have been consistently searching for solutions with higher aerodynamic efficiency, Blended Wing Body (BWB) is one of the most innovative concepts in recent decades. Research and experiments have been done by NASA and leading aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.

BWB has no clear definition of the fuselage and wings, instead they are merged into one to generate uniform lift across the whole body. This reduces the interference drag that is present on conventional aircraft due to the mixing of airstream at the intersection of the fuselage and wings. The large lift-generating area also ensures a better aerodynamic performance with high lift-to-drag ratio.

However, before the BWB aircraft can be certified for commercialisation, many issues are still to be addressed and investigated.

Compared to the traditional tubular aircraft body, the cabin pressurisation loads on a relatively flat shaped BWB aircraft are not uniformly distributed across the whole surface, therefore stiffer materials may be required that can potentially lead to added weight.

Without the conventional tail section for yawing and pitching, additional control surfaces or control surface areas might be necessary for effective manoeuvres. Additional trainings will also be needed for pilots to adjust to the new system.

Aside from certain technical aspects, another factor that hugely impacts the success of BWB aircraft to the current aviation industry is the acceptance from the public travellers. As comfort becomes the key to offering the best experiences to the passengers, the interior seating layout design can definitely be given more thought by the manufacturers and airlines.

Do you ever get frustrated when you satisfactorily purchased a window seat on a popular flying route, only to end up sitting beside a block of solid cabin wall with the fuselage structural frame welded behind? Most of us all enjoy the bird-eye view sceneries through the portholes that we rarely get to see on the ground. However, it is even more challenging to do so on a wide bodied BWB aircraft as most seats are arranged at the spacious centre of the aircraft.

In the conceptual rendered image of MAVERIC BWB aircraft, Airbus appears to have used digitally projected windows to simulate the view outside. However, the sense of security is still compromised while being trapped in a space 35,000 feet above the ground unaware of what is happening outside.

The additional structural support required for the wide fuselage can also restrict the freedom of cabin arrangement to some degree, this has also led to the idea of possibly cabin segmentation to better utilise the space for higher profitability.

Revolutionary concepts propel the development in the aviation industry, once all the barriers are overcome, BWB might be the new norm for the next generation of aviation.
