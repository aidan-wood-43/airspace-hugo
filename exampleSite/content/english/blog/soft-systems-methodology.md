##### **The 7 Steps Model**

The 7 Step model is as demonstrated in Figure 1 and can be seen to differentiate the steps regarding if they are to be considered in the real world or in the systems thinking world (ie. how reality affects the problem and how human actions can influence how reality affects the problem). The most important components of the 7 Step model are the Rich Picture, the conceptual model, formulating root definition(s) and the formal systems model \[3\]. An initial noticeable difference in comparison to other models is the use of round shapes and curved arrows used in hand drawn diagrams. Typically, the style conveys the fact that this is a working model which is relevant in the current climate and undermines the certainty of rigid shapes and straight arrows to give a more human and organic feel \[1\]. Additionally, the use of 7 steps is the optimal number dictated by Miller’s work on human perception “The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information”, whereby he determined that the human brain can cope with around 7 items or concepts at once \[1\]. Limiting the steps to within this range allows for easy retention so that it may be used swiftly in practice.

The 7 steps are as follows \[3\]:

**Step 1: Appreciate the situation.** Define the scope of the problem from all contexts and perspectives before undertaking research surrounding the problem such as key stakeholders, current performance, latest innovation and any issues.

**Step 2:** **Express the situation.** It is recommended by Checkland et al that this be achieved through the creation of a Rich Picture which encompasses various perceptions surrounding the problem. The Rich Picture is a pictorial representation of the problem with its surrounding factors which allows for better representation due to the increased density of information provided. It should allow for differences of interpretation, agreement on found interpretations and to identify the themes for the systems.

**Step 3:** **Formulate root definitions.** The root definition should capture the transformation performed by the system, as it is from this that all logical steps to achieve this transformation are derived. The ensure the suitability of the root definition, the mnemonic CATWOE is implemented where:

**C –** Customer: those who receive from the output

**A –** Actor: who would do the transformation

**T –** Transformation: the activity which turns the input into the output

**W –** Weltanschauung: the world view in relation to the root definition

**O –** Owner: the decision maker who is focussed on the system performance

**E –** Environmental constraints: key constraints outside the system boundary which affect the system

Furthermore, Checkland proposed the following rules for defining the transformation \[3\]:

· The transformation transforms the input into the output

· The input must be present in the output but in a changed state

· An abstract input must yield an abstract output

· A concrete input must yield a concrete output

**Step 4: Build conceptual model of the human activity system.** Produce a logical view of the activities necessary to achieve a system purpose. The conceptual model should focus on 7±2 activities of roughly the same scale where each activity description begins with an imperative or command verb. An arrow should be used to display logical dependence and numbers can also be incorporated for traceability. As this methodology and conceptual model were developed for Human Activity Systems (HAS) where the activities are undertaken by human control rather than computers, monitoring and controlling must be introduced so that the variability in the performance from humans can be assessed. The conceptual model should be a system which can adapt and survive in a changing environment, hence, according to Checkland, “any \[human activity\] system model is thus a combination of an operational subsystem and a monitoring and control system” \[3\]. The monitoring and control approach was expressed as the 3 E’s:

· Effective: is the system doing the right thing

· Efficacy: is the system producing the desired result

· Efficient: is the system using the minimum resources

From the 3 E’s, two levels of monitoring and control were deemed necessary where the first would regard the efficiency and efficacy of the operational activities, and the second would regard the effectiveness of the monitored and controlled operational activities. This is represented pictorially in Figure 1.

**Step 5: Compare the model with the real world.** The comparison of the output of the model to the real world allows for discussion as to where the improvements could be made. Such improvements should be noted and then assessed in the next step.

**Step 6: Define desirable and feasible changes.** Generally, not all improvements can be made to a system due to restrictions in resources (people, time, funding etc.). Therefore, any improvement(s) should be vetted to see which are desirable in principle and feasible to implement \[1\]. This process could be completed from a discussion or through the establishment of a ease-benefit matrix, as shown in Figure … . The size of the circle indicates the quantity of resources required. Upon the decision of improvement(s) to be implemented, a logical order and timescale should be decided.

**Step 7: Take action to improve the problem.** Implement the improvement(s) decided upon. This will provide new data for further improvement or issues, and so the process repeats.
